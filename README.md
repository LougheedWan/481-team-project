## Project Phases
<details>
<summary>Stage 1</summary>
<br>
In stage 1 we developed our team contract, which provided us guidelines on acceptable behaviour within our Team.

The link to our Team Contract: [Team Contract](../Stage_one/TeamM_TeamContractHandout.pdf)
<br/><br/>
We also prepared a project proposal with potential project ideas. We came up with roughly 10-15 ideas and narrowed it down to 3.
<br/>
The 3 are listed on this doc: [Team Proposal](../Stage_one/CPSC_481_Team_Proposal.pdf)

<summary>Stage 2</summary>

For this iteration, we were tasked with solidifying a single idea, in which we chose our game matchmaking pick from iteration 1 and we were also tasked
with implementing user research methods to get information on what our potential clients would want.
<br/>
We then put it all in a report: [Stage 2 Report](../Stage_two/Stage_2.pdf)
